# Question

Will the code work? Why or why not?

```js
const getUsers = async () => {
	const url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users";
	const users = await fetch(url)
		.then((r) => r.json())
		.catch((err) => []);
	console.log(users);
	return users;
};
getUsers();
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer

I believe the code will work because it is properly structured to handle asynchronous operations. On line 6, the function is declared as `async`, allowing the use of `await` within it. Then, on line 8, the `await` keyword is used with the `fetch` method. This ensures that the variable will be assigned the resolved promise value, as `await` makes the code wait for the `fetch` operation to complete before setting the variable.
