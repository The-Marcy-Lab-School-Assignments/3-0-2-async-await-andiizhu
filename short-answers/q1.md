# Question

Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer

The ways in which `async` and `await` is more readable then `.then` and `.catch` is that it is more similar to synchronous code. Using `.then` and `.catch` are both methods that contains callback functions. Having multiple callbacks can create mistakes such as not returning a value.
