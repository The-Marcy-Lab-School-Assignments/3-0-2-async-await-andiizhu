# Question

Is this function safe? Why or why not?

```js
const getUser = async (userId) => {
	const url = `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}`;
	const response = await fetch(url);
	const users = await response.json();
	console.log(users);
	return users;
};
getUser(-1);
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer

I don't think that function is safe. Because on like 8, after the `fetch` has been complete, there is no chaining to identify if the response is sucessful. There is no `try` `catch` that is set up in order to have a guard function if the `response.ok` is `false`. It also appears that the `getUser()` function is being called with `-1` which is unlikely a correct userId for the website.

This is a tricky question and I don't think that we talked about this exact thing in class so I'm not taking points off for this question to anyone. Here is some context on what we meant by this question and how you could answer it:

The function is technically safe to run in the context of interacting with the JSONPlaceholder API because:

* Network Safety: The URL being used is safe and not harmful.
* API Behavior: JSONPlaceholder handles invalid user IDs gracefully by returning an empty object, which does not cause immediate crashes or harmful behavior.

While the function is safe to run, it lacks robustness and best practices for error handling. This makes it potentially unsafe in a broader context or with different APIs.

* Error Handling: Without a try/catch block, any network error or issue in parsing JSON will cause the function to throw an unhandled exception.
* Response Validation: Without checking response.ok, the function assumes all responses are valid JSON, which may not be true.
* Invalid Input Handling: Passing -1 as a userId might work with JSONPlaceholder, but relying on this behavior is not good practice.
