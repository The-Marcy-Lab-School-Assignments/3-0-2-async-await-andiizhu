# Question

This code snippet makes a fetch to get the first todo item from the JSON placeholder API. Or at least it tries to.

What is wrong with this code?

Describe how async/await helps us avoid this mistake.

```js
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
	.then((response) => {
		if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Fetch failed!");
		response.json();
	})
	.then((json) => console.log(json))
	.catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

You can run this code of course, but try not to! Try to figure out the issue on your own.

# Answer

What is wrong with the code is that on line 13, the `response.json()` is not being returned. As a result, no promise is being outputed for the `.then` on line 15.
